# Class 20 + 21: Making our webapps sing

This week we're adding [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) to our apps, so they're not only functional but attractive and map-ful (no d3 required!).

Class contents are in [the 21-compiled.zip file](https://github.com/jsoma/storytelling-2015/raw/master/class-21-22/21-compiled.zip), which is the same as last time, *except* for the addition of [add_lat_lng.py](https://github.com/jsoma/storytelling-2015/blob/master/class-21-22/add_lat_lng.py)

### Review

If you want to review, take a look at my [webapps tutorials](http://jonathansoma.com/tutorials/webapps/) (steps 5-9, I think), it's very close to what we did in class.
