## Homework 9

Use [population.csv](https://github.com/jsoma/storytelling-2015/raw/master/class-09-10/population.csv) and make a map of the world, using:

* Use color for the country or region
* Use circle radius to stand for the population

Focus it on any particular part of the world using `.center()` and `.scale()`, and feel free to play around with the [other options and projections](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Geo-Projections). Write a little summary of your "findings."

Turn it in by Thursday 9AM by posting in `#storytelling-hw`.
