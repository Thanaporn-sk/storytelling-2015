## Homework 9

Use [population.csv](https://github.com/jsoma/storytelling-2015/raw/master/class-09-10/population.csv) and make a map of the world, using:

* Use color for the country or region
* Use circle radius to stand for the population

Focus it on any particular part of the world using `.center() and `.scale()` and write a little summary of your "findings."

Turn it in by Thursday 9AM by posting in `#storytelling-hw`.
