### Class 5 Homework

This homework is a breather to help you relax, focus on what you know, and possibly flex your wings a bit.

Make two charts of any type, using data of your choosing (at least 10 data points apiece). I like to use Wikipedia's [Lists of Lists of Lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_lists_of_lists) and [Lists of Lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Lists_of_lists) to find fun data sets.

Only requirements are:

* Use `d3.scale.linear() on both
* Make an infobox for *at least* one of them
* Use click and/or hover events to provide some sort of interactivity

Submit your neocities.org URLs in #storytelling by 9:00am on Thursday.
